# companion-module-soundcraft-ui

## Getting started

Execute `yarn` command to install the dependencies.
The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.
While developing the module, by using `yarn dev` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.
